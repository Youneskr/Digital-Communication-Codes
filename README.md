# Digital Communication Codes

This repository includes MATLAB scripts for digital communication encoding schemes. The implemented codes cover Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ), Manchester, and Miller encoding techniques. These scripts (.m files) can be used as a reference for understanding and implementing these encoding methods in digital communication systems.

## Contents

- **nrz.m**: MATLAB script for generating a Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) coded signal.
- **manchester.m**: MATLAB script for generating a Manchester coded signal.
- **miller.m**: MATLAB script for generating a Miller coded signal.

## Usage
